# Exno.7-Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# AI Tools Required: 
ChatGPT (GPT-5) or any comparable Large Language Model (LLM)

Optional: Python (for a simple CLI or web interface)

Optional: Browser or mobile interface for testing

# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

# Features Implemented

Daily Task Manager – add, list, and mark tasks complete.

Smart Scheduler / Reminders – stores due-times and checks what is due soon.

Wellness Tips – random, easy tips; adapts slightly based on your stored preferences.

General Q&A (mocked) – simple keyword-based answers to simulate LLM help.

How It Demonstrates the Procedure

Define requirements – tasks, scheduler, wellness, Q&A.

Prompt construction – the mock mock_llm_response simulates an LLM answering natural questions.

Natural interaction – CLI accepts commands in everyday language.

Feedback & adaptation – tracks which wellness tips you pick most and surfaces them more often.

Optional memory – preferences stored in self.user_prefs during the session.

# Running & Extending

Run in a terminal: python assistant_app.py

Use commands like:

add → “Remind me to call mom” with a deadline.

tip → get wellness advice.

ask → “Give me a motivational quote.”

To connect to real LLMs, replace mock_llm_response() with an actual API call (e.g., OpenAI’s openai.ChatCompletion.create()).


# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:
 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.
 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.
 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.
 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
